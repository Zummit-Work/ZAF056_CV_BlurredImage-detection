# CV_02_BlurredImagesDetection

### Project Description
There is a dataset of images, par of which is blurred. The task is to develop a machine learning algorithm to detect whether the image is blurred or sharp on the unknown dataset.

### Data Description
The dataset consists of images, and some of them are blurred. The images are blurred using augmentation.

#### Data files:
- ```train``` - a folder for training
- ```test``` - a folder with images, for which we make predicitons
- ```train.csv``` - labels (answers) to the train sample: **if 1, the image is blurred.**
